name = Imagefield Preview Generator
project = imagefield_prev_generator
description = Hacky module to generate previews from PDFs into an Imagefield. Processed fields are hard-coded into module, so if you need another preview generated, you must edit the generateSourceTargetArray() function. Originally ported and simplified from pdf_to_imagefield module but most of that code isn't present anymore.
